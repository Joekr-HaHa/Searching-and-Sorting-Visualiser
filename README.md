This is a visualiser for common searching and sorting algorithms, including:

Searching:
* Linear Search
* Binary Search

Sorting:
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort

The user inputs a number corresponding to the search or sort they want to use

They are then asked to input the numbers to be searched/ sorted; separated by commas

Then the program will show each stage of the chosen algorithm, as shown by the image above; in the case of merge sort
